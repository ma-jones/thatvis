   <h2>Designing Ethernet and Wireless Networks</h2>
   <p>The IP network is the backbone of every modern custom installation and the number of connected devices is ever growing. With this in mind, it is now crucial that the fundamental design of any home network is robust and well conceived. It is no longer good enough to just ‘plug it in to any available socket’ come install time!</p>
   
   <p>This course explores all aspects of modern network topology including traffic flow, infrastructure planning, connectivity options and planned redundancy. During the session, students will be work in groups to develop a robust network that will be stable for an initial and developing list of connected host devices. Wired and wireless connectivity will be included as well as host devices from the AV, computing and mobile world.</p>
